        <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
           Only 9% of plastic has actually been recycled. This is significant as the evasion of proper recycling habits causes habitat destruction, pollution, and the emission of greenhouse gases which contributes to climate change. Other than the threat posed to the sustainability of resources, as finite materials which could be recycled and reused are needlessly wasted as they accumulate in landfills. Interestingly enough, it has been found that the reasons for low rates of recycling include apathy, carelessness, and ambiguity. With the aid of software development and AI, we knew something could be done to prevent low rates of recycling.

        <h2>Governments</h2>
        <p>
             Below are the Windows and MacOS zip file deployments of an auxiliary computer application in the Recyclify suite. This application, in particular, allows governments to determine the percentage of waste treated by recycling by country based on widely available data pertaining to waste. The resulting predictions are highly accurate and precise, and this allows governments and political actors to enact environmentally conscious legislation appropriately.

        <h2>Scanner</h2>
        <p>
            The primary function of our mobile application allows users to take and upload photos of images of waste products and determine what material they are and whether they are recyclable or not. This solves the problem of ambiguity and confusion surrounding recycling as the results of the particular scan will indicate whether or not the material is recyclable. This is extremely useful because 80% of all trash in land fills is recyclable. These items take up space that could be used for the items that are truly waste and cannot be decomposed.

        <h2>Bin Detection</h2>
        <p>
            Additionally our app is also able to detect if a bin is a recycling, trash, or compost bin. Our models used for visually detecting the type of trash bin and recycling material were built using PyTorch. As for the algorithms themselves, we utilized the publicly available ResNet-18 visual Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and performed training using the Adam optimizer. We utilized Google Colab's access to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate training time and model development. Our datasets were manually scrapped and curated.
